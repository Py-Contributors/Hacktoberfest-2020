### But there are some rules for Hacktoberfest and here we go:
To earn your Hacktoberfest tee or tree reward, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31, 2020 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project‚Äôs code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 70,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a prize.
